       /* -Declare int variables: seniorCitizens, nonSeniorCitizens, age
                -Create a Scanner object
                - Ask user to enter count for seniorCitizens and nonSeniorCitizens using message:
        "Enter current count for seniorCitizens and nonSeniorCitizens:"

                -Ask user to enter age:
        "What is new citizen's age?"

                -if citizen's age is more than or equals to 65 then print "Senior Citizen" and increment seniorCitizens variable by 1.

                -if citizen's age is less than 65 then print "Non-Senior Citizen" and increment nonSeniorCitizens variable by 1.

                -At last, print another message:
